# New Moon: PsychSanctum
>DESIGNATION: PsychSanctum

>RISK LEVEL: A

>POPULATION: Once filled with tormented souls, now abandoned, lost to the encroaching forest.

>CONDITIONS: PsychSanctum stands as a decaying monument to human suffering, its corridors echoing with the whispers of the past. The walls are stained with the memories of those who were confined within its confines, their anguish seeping into every crack and crevice.

>FAUNA: Shy woodland creatures hide among the overgrowth, their presence hinted at by fleeting glimpses and rustling leaves.

>HISTORY: PsychSanctum was once a place of refuge for the mentally ill, a sanctuary where they could seek solace from a world that had cast them aside. But as the years passed, it became a prison, its patients subjected to cruel and inhumane treatments in the name of science.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Storms rage, rain pours, fog blankets

>ROUTING COST: 410
