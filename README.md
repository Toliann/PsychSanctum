# New Moon: PsychSanctum
>DESIGNATION: PsychSanctum

>POPULATION: Once teeming with the tormented souls of the afflicted, now abandoned and left to the mercy of the encroaching wilderness.

>CONDITIONS: PsychSanctum stands as a decaying monument to human suffering, its corridors echoing with the whispers of the past. The walls are stained with the memories of those who were confined within its confines, their anguish seeping into every crack and crevice.

>FAUNA: Nature has reclaimed PsychSanctum, its halls now inhabited by creatures both mundane and malevolent. The rustling of leaves and the haunting cries of unseen animals create an atmosphere of dread and uncertainty.

>HISTORY: PsychSanctum was once a place of refuge for the mentally ill, a sanctuary where they could seek solace from a world that had cast them aside. But as the years passed, it became a prison, its patients subjected to cruel and inhumane treatments in the name of science.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Storms rage, rain pours, fog blankets

>ROUTING COST: 410
